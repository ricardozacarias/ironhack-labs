Remember that **some of the questions are not about coding**. **You will need to provide some analysis reasoning**.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
